# hot-resturant

## Overview

This repo has an example of a simple express app the serves html and json data.

### App details

This project is from a coding bootcamp.

The main parts of the app are:

* server.js - listens on port 3000 for requests
* public files - contains the HTML files for the application
* routing - files for handling the routing of html navigation and calls to the api
* data - simple starter files with arrays of json data

As the app uses non-persistent data, reloading the app will result in only the start files being read.

### Use cases

This simple app enables users to create reservations for a restaurant.

The user can:
 * View the tables and waiting list
 * Create a reservation
 * Clear the data
 * View the json data arrays
